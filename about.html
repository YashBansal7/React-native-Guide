<p>     Engineers at Facebook, while working on designing the different complex Facebook apps,
        realized that the declarative style of coding would make their app organization easy.</p>

        <p>       They developed a new programming language called JSX and a new mobile development
        framework called React Native to help build powerful and complex apps in an easy way. </p> 

        <p>        JSX combines both HTML and Javascript style of coding. JSX is declarative - we tell what are
        the different components we want in the application. </p> 

        <p>   We can write JSX and React Native code in an online editor called 'snack'. </p> 

                <p>  'Snack' is an online editor written by Expo, which allows us to write and compile React
        Native code in an online environment. We can also preview the output of the code using
        Snack.</p>

      <p>  You can see the output for either Android, iOS or Web. </p>

</div>
      <p>  For Android/iOS, you can see the output either on your phone or on the android emulator in
the browser. (By clicking Run on your device.)</p>

<p>For Android/iOS, you can install Expo Client, sign in with the same account and open the
project from under Projects Tab.</p>

<p>For Android, you can also scan the QR Code.
(Encourage the student to scan the QR code from their Expo App and check the output.)</p>

<p>For seeing the output on the device emulator in the browser, you have to press "Tap to
play". You might have to wait in a queue as there are many systems online using a common
emulator.</p>
